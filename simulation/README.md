# Running simulations with Madgraph, Delphes, and Pythia

## Getting Started
- Run *setupSimulations.sh*
- This will install Madgraph, Delphes, and Pythia here and make them all talk to each other
- Do this **every time** you want to run simulations to initialize the software. It will only download them all the first time, but it's needed every time to initialize them.
